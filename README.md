Dungeon Sketch is a tabletop roleplaying game suppliment for Android tablets.

It is intended to support a "lo-fi" roleplaying methodology:
- The map can either be imported as an image or drawn using simple vector-based drawing tools
- Players and monsters are represented with circular tokens.  The app provides a predefined library, or import your own!
- There is support for a hidden "GM Notes" layer, and a temporary player notes layer in addition to the map.
- There is support to hide and show portions of the map with a "mask" feature.  This lets you draw your entire dungeon ahead of time and reveal it when the time is right!
